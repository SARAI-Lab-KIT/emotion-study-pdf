The pixelbot_tablet package has been tested under [ROS2 Jazzy](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/index.html) on Ubuntu 24.04.
This is research code, expect that it changes often and any fitness for a particular purpose is disclaimed.

## Installation

### Building from Source

#### Dependencies

- [Robot  Operating System (ROS2)](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/index.html) (middleware for robotics).
- [Pygame-ce](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) (Python game developping library) for developping the drawing application running on the tablet.
    ```
    sudo apt install python3-pygame-ce
    ```
- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) and [cv-bridge](https://pypi.org/project/cv-bridge/): Computer vision Python library.
    ```
	sudo pip3 install opencv-python
    sudo pip3 install cv-bridge
    ```  
- [evdev](https://pypi.org/project/evdev/) to obtain the data from the tablet and pen (pressure, etc).
    ```
    sudo pip3 install evdev
    ``` 

#### Building

1) Copy this package in your ROS2 workspace (e.g. `~/ros2_ws/src`).

2) Build the package with colcon:
    ```
    cd ~/ros2_ws
    colcon build --packages-select pixelbot_tablet
    ```

## Usage

You can run the main node with:
```
ros2 run pixelbot_tablet draw_node
```
